# Python DSA Learning Repo

A personal repository to systematically learn **Data Structures & Algorithms using Python**.
Each topic contains problem solutions, reusable templates, and concise notes.

---

## Learning Approach
- One topic per week (e.g., Arrays, Strings)
- Problems solved incrementally (easy → medium)
- Emphasis on patterns, not brute memorization
- Every solution includes:
  - Time & space complexity
  - Edge-case handling
  - Clean, readable logic
