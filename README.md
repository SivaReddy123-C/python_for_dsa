# Python DSA Learning Repo

A personal repository to learn Python for data structures and algorithms (DSA). Contains solutions, notes, and utilities.

## Structure
- solutions/
  - arrays/
  - strings/
  - linked_list/
  - trees/
  - graphs/
  - dp/
  - utils/
- notes/
- README.md

## How to run solutions
Each solution file contains a `solve()` or `main` function with input examples in comments.
To run a solution:
```
python solutions/arrays/two_sum.py
```

## Branching & contribution workflow
- Work on a branch: `feature/<short-desc>` (e.g., `feature/week-02-arrays`)
- Commit often: `git commit -m "feat: add sliding window template"`
- Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/week-02-arrays`
- Create a Pull Request on GitHub and merge once reviewed.

## Commit message guideline
- Use short, meaningful messages:
  - `feat: add binary-search template`
  - `fix: handle edge-case for empty tree`
  - `docs: update README`

## Notes
- I use `main` as the default branch.
- Keep tests or example input in the same file as comments.
